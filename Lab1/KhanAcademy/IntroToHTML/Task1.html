    <h1> The Negro Speaks of Rivers </h1>
    
    <h3> Langston Hughes 1901 â€“1967 </h3>
    
    <p> I've known rivers:<br>
    I've known rivers ancient as the world and     older than the<br>
    flow of human blood in human veins.<br><br>
    My soul has grown deep like the rivers.<br>
    I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were      young.<br><br>
    I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled     me to sleep.<br>
    I looked upon the Nile and raised the         pyramids above it.<br>
    I heard the singing of the Mississippi when     Abe Lincoln<br>
    went down to New Orleans, and I've seen        its muddy<br>
    bosom turn all golden in the sunset.<br><br>

    I've known rivers:<br>
    Ancient, dusky rivers.<br><br>

    My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
